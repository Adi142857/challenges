# Symbols
There is a problem with your keyboard: it randomly writes symbols when you are typing a text. You need to clean up the text by removing all symbols.

## Task:
Take a text that includes some random symbols and translate it into a text that has none of them. The resulting text should only include letters and numbers.

## Input Format:
A string with random symbols.

## Output Format:
A string of the text with all the symbols removed.

## Sample Input:
```
#l$e%ts go @an#d@@ g***et #l#unch$$$
```

## Sample Output:
```
lets go and get lunch
```

## Explanation:
If you take out every symbol and leave only the letters and numbers, your text says **lets go and get lunch**.
