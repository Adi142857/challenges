# The Spy Life
You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher.

## Task:
Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message.

## Input Format:
A string of characters that represent the encoded message.

## Output Format:
A string of character that represent the intended secret message.
 
## Sample Input:
```
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H
```

## Sample Output:
```
Hello World
```

## Explanation:
If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original message and flip it around, you get 'Hello World'.
